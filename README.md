## Hello, I'm Loffert ðŸ‘‹

## - ðŸ”­ I'm a 24 year old student at FTCC working on my Associates in Database Management

## - ðŸ‘½ I do illustration work and I love UFOlogy, or really any kind of fringe science. If there's a bad TV documentary about it from the 70s I will probably watch it. But I do love normal films as well, and I play video games in my free time (Though almost predominantly just old point & click and text adventure games...)
## - ðŸŒ± I'm studying database to move into the information & library sciences, archival work and digital preservation is something I'm really passionate about so the bulk of my programming knowledge (which is little) has been with SQL. That's all!
