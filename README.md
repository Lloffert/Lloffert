## Hello, I'm Loffert ðŸ‘‹

## I'm 24, I do illustration work and I'm in the database management program here at FTCC. I like UFOlogy and general fringe science nonsense, and probably some other things too I'm sure. I'm studying database to move into the information & library sciences, which I'm pretty passionate about, so the bulk of my programming knowledge (which is little) has been with SQL. That's all!
